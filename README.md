## About The Project

The goal of the Alumni web application is to provide an environment for Alumni students or earlier students a comprehensive way of communicating with each other. The goal is to provide  different ways of creating and managing Events, Groups and topics. The task of the Alumni case project is to facilitate a way to create communication between old Noroff Candidates, Noroff and Experis.

## Getting Started

The Web Applciation is made with React and Typescript on the frontend, together with ASP .NET on the backend. The web app can be deployed further in Azure and will be able to integrate such that the frontend repo is available with the backend repo: [Backend Repo](https://github.com/Alumni-Universe/AlumniNetworkApi)

### Prerequisites

You need to have a few tools installed to be able to run the frontend.

Earlier it is mentioned that React was used in this project therefore we need the tools for installation and we also need to install the libraries. 
To install React we need npm and Node.js, this can be done through here: [Download npm and Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

Lastly we need to install the important Libraries that were used in this project. These were installed through the command line.

`npm install react`
`npm i keycloak-js`

However, these will be taken care of (and the other libraries) by running this command alone:

`npm install`

Please keep in mind that you need to have npm and node.js installed and ready to be able to run these commands, and make sure you are in the working directory while running these commands.
